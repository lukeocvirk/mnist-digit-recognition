# MNIST-Digit-Recognition

This project uses the MNIST dataset to train a model to recognize hand-drawn digits using pytorch and tensorflow. The project comes with a set of digits I hand-drew myself for testing in the samples folder.

If you wish to add your own hand-drawn digits, you should add them in this folder. Digit images should have a black background and white digits for best performance.

To train and test the model, simply run the main.py Python file.
